# Contributing to NumStore

Thank you for your interest in contributing to NumStore! This guide will help you get started.

As of Jan 1 2026, contributions are welcome with review. Please reach out to me directly if you are interested in contributing.

## Talk to me first
This is a small project and I'd like to stay in the loop before work begins. If you have an idea for a feature, fix, or improvement, open an issue or reach out before you start coding. This avoids wasted effort and keeps things moving in a consistent direction.

All pull requests go through my review before merging. Feel free to push back during review.

## AI usage
Using AI tools to help you understand the codebase, brainstorm approaches, or work through problems is fine. What I won't accept is PRs that are clearly generated wholesale by AI and submitted without real understanding or review on your end. If I can tell the code wasn't written or vetted by a human who understands what it does, it'll be rejected.
